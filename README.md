This GitHub repo contains the source code to create the figures in
the manuscript "A microstructure-informed continuum model of transversely
isotropic, fibre-reinforced hydrogels".

The code is written in Python and it makes use of the 
[ucompress.py](https://github.com/hennessymatt/ucompress.py)
package for carrying out simulations of unconfined compression experiments.
